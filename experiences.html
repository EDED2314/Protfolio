                During the summer of 2025, I worked as a research assistant under Dr. Lele of the Mechanical and
                Aerospace Engineering Department, contributing to a larger project to discover thermoelectric
                materials with a higher zT figure of merit than currently known materials through deep neural networks.
                My specific role was to investigate the effects of line defects in thermoelectric materials on lattice
                thermal conductivity using molecular dynamic simulations in <a href="https://www.lammps.org/"
                  target="_blank">LAMMPS
                </a>(Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator).
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                To do this, I created scripts using Python and Bash to generate atomic structures with line and point
                defects, created <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/" target="_blank">Slurm</a> workflows to run
                molecular dynamics
                simulations on Purdue's Anvil supercomputers, and analyzed the resulting heat flux data to construct
                an autocorrelation function and then extract thermal conductivity values using the Green-Kubo method.
                Specific packages I used include
                <a href=" https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, <a href=" https://ase-lib.org/"
                  target="_blank">ASE</a>, <a href=" https://scipy.org/" target="_blank">SciPy</a>, <a
                  href=" https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas</a>, and <a href=" https://numpy.org/"
                  target="_blank">NumPy</a>.
              </div>
              <div class=" body-text">
                During the process of creating the experiment and simulation setup, I had to
                reference different papers to ensure the validity of the experiment. For example, I learned accurate
                methods in determining the cutoff time for the Green-Kubo integral for thermal conductivity and
                generating stable and realistic line defects in their correct planes that occur in pure Silicon.
              </div>
              <div class=" body-text">
                In the end, my work culminated in being the lead author on an in-preparation manuscript investigating
                line defect effects on thermal conductivity in silicon and germanium. Troubleshot the different and
                many issues that came up, and learning about new ways to conduct experiments helped me grow to be more
                flexible and develop my problem-solving abilities.

                During the summer of 2024, I worked as a research intern under Prof. Ju in the Mechanical and Aerospace
                Engineering Department at Princeton. My research focused on using <a href="https://www.vasp.at/"
                  target="_blank">VASP</a>(Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) to simulate
                reaction pathways of NHx, N, and H species on WO₃ (001) surfaces to help understand how plasma can
                catalyze eNRR (electrochemical nitrogen reduction reactions) through a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)
                mechanism.
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                To study different reaction pathways and energies, I created a custom VASP-based
                <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/" target="_blank">Slurm</a> workflow in Python for one of Princeton's
                supercomputing
                clusters that analyzed POSCAR, XDATCAR, OSZICAR, and OUTCAR files from VASP to obtain relaxation
                energies, create custom screenshots of the simulated systems, and analyze bonds between specific
                species. In <a href="https://github.com/EDED2314/VASP-scripts" target="_blank">my scripts</a>, I used <a
                  href="
                  https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, <a href=" https://ase-lib.org/"

              </div>

              <div class=" body-text">
                Before I left, I took the lead to start a project by using DeepMD-kit to develop ML force fields
                tailored to NHx, N, and H species' interactions with WO3 surfaces for an increase in DFT simulation
                speeds.

                As Vice President of the Aerospace Club, I was originally one of the founders of our school's Rocketry
                Team competing in <a href="https://rocketrychallenge.org/" target="_blank">TARC</a> (The American
                Rocketry Challenge), which later
                merged with the Aerospace Club.
                For the board, we qualified for the TARC national competition twice.
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                Over the summer before taking the role of VP, I created, with the board, a <a
                  href="https://youtu.be/kmTOjdBCODs" target="_blank">video</a> guide on how to build a
                model rocket for TARC using Fusion 360, OpenRocket, and tools found in our workshop. Using this, I
                guided weekly meetings with 30+ students to not only design, build, and 3D print rockets for TARC, but
                also write CubeSat and Techrise proposals. When the time came, I supervised each rocket launch and acted
                as the safety officer for all the students' rockets, improving the safety and efficiency of their test
                launches.
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                To fund these activities, I planned and organized fundraising events over the course of my three years
                on the board, raising $15K+ through STEM fundraiser initiatives, impacting over 100 primary and middle
                school students.
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                In addition to leading students, I earned my HAM Radio Technician Class License in preparation for the
                board's proposal for the NASA CubeSat challenge and future endeavors.
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                Over the course of a few years, I helped increase member attendance and retention by 10% (using
                attendance form data) by fostering a close-knit, community-first team culture.
              </div>
              <div class="body-text">
                Before I became a board member, my team under the Aerospace Club qualified for the National <a
                  href="https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-flight-opportunities/access-flight-tests/techrise/"
                  target="_blank">NASA
                  TechRise</a> challenge. In this, I spearheaded the soldering, wiring, and design of our avionics
                payload
                that collected low-g and high-g acceleration for the mission of creating an algorithm to characterize
                the vibrational frequencies of a Rocket. In order to do so, I also programmed a script in Python to use
                FFT to analyze
                the data. Unfortunately, NASA never returned our payload due to difficulties, but my knowledge of these
                systems has still increased.
